# OOP345

<h5> To strangers or anyone with intent to copy this code for their personal academic success: </h5>
</br>
<p1>This is Yathavan Parameshwaran's repository for OOP345 workshops and assignments. All files in here are </p1><strong>not allowed</strong><p1> to be copied, cloned, or otherwise downloaded without the explicit permission of Yathavan Parameshwaran. </p1> <p2>(Besides, half the code in here might be filled with bugs and stuff, do you really want to copy this and risk failing?)</p2>
</br></br>
<h5> To anyone with doubt regarding if it is really me writing this code, or me copying the code from someplace else: </h5>
</br>
<p1> I created this repository (and this Github account) in order to organize and keep track of my code. I am the one and only owner of https://github.com/rivalDevYP and I am the sole contributer to all code in this repository (OOP345). This repository is linked to my local machine, and my Visual Studio 2017, to make it easier for me to add/delete/modify anything and just push it from there. </p1>
</br>
<p1> If you are </p1><i>still</i><p1> in doubt of the validity of this code or me being the sole contributor, you are more than welcome to request to see my local machine, and track the changes I made. I will only allow you to do so in person, AND if I know you. If I don't know you or like you, then I will get you detained for attempted robbery. </p1> 
</br></br>
<p1> Regards, </p1></br><p1>Yathavan (rivalDevYP)</p1>
