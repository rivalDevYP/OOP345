Workshop 2 Reflection

In this workshop I have learned
	
	- anonymous structs
		- a struct is like a class, but it is public by default
		- 
	- unions
	- std::chrono
	- copy constructors
	- copy assignment operators
	- move constructors
	- move assignment operators
	- size_t
	- addresses and pointers
	
				
				
Basic questions required by guidelines : 

	- the reason for the difference between the copy and move operations
	
		- 
		
	- the dynamic allocation of addresses to objects instead of objects themselves
	
		- 
		
	- the changes you made in upgrading your w2 and Text modules
	
		-
